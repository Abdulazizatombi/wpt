# Code of Conduct

Contact: a moderator ([see below](#moderators)), or a member of the WPT community that you feel you can trust.

## Conduct

* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all,
 regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
 disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
 * Please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
 * Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
 * Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation
 choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
 * Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
 * We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/); if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In
 particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
 * Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact one of the moderators immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.
 * Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behaviour
 is not welcome.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community’s standards of conduct. If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact one of [the moderators](#moderators).

* Remarks that violate this code of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)
* Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.
* Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
* If the warning is unheeded, the user will be “kicked,” i.e., kicked out of the communication channel to cool off.
* If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.
* Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
* If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, **in private**. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.
* Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.

In the WPT community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don’t just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they’re off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could’ve communicated better — remember that it’s your responsibility to make your fellow testers comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.

The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official WPT venues: official IRC channels (#testing on irc.w3.org); GitHub repositories under the web-platform-tests organization; and the public-test-infra@w3.org mailing list.

There may arise situations where both the WPT code of conduct and that of another organization (such as the WHATWG or W3C) may apply. For example, a WPT-focused meeting at [TPAC](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/TPOverview.html) would involve both the WPT code of conduct and the [W3C code of conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/). In such situations we operate under all code of conducts involved. To continue the example of a WPT-focused meeting at TPAC, attendees would be expected to respect both the WPT code of conduct and the W3C code of conduct. If you are placed in a situation where you feel this is inappropriate (e.g. if you believe the code of conducts involved contradict one another), please contact a [moderator](#moderators).
